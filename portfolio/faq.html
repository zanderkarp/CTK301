		<div id="smallWrapper">

		<h3>Is Zander short for something, like Alexander?</h3>
		<p>No.</p>

		<h3>What do you use to make your art?</h3>
		<p>Photoshop.</p>

		<h3>What inspires you to make your art?</h3>
		<p>I usually just have an idea and go for it.
			There's no wrong answers in art...at least that's what my mom tells me.
			And I never doubt my mom. </p>

		<h3>What is your art process?</h3>
		<p>I sketch out my ideas like a kindergartener just picked up a pencil for the first time.
			After that, I go section by section and repeat to myself "Trust the process"
			while it looks like a drawing your kid made for the fridge until it looks amazing.
			Works every time.</p>

		<h3> What's with the different color eye? </h3>
		<p> It's the evil eye. I have a necklace of it and it's my favorite. Like an
			"I don't care if the colors don't match my outfit today" kind of favorite.
			So every time I draw myself, I give myself an evil eye.

		<h3> Why do you never draw your glasses in your self portraits?</h3>
		<p> I forget to every single time. </p>

		<h3>Do you have any advice for any aspiring artists?</h3>
		<p>If you find a coin on the floor, only pick it up if it's heads side up.
			If it's tails side up, don't do it, it's not worth it.</p>
